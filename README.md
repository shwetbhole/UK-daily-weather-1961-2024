# 🌦️ UK Daily Weather Analysis (1961–2024)

> Analyzing UK daily weather data from 1961 to 2024 to uncover long-term climate trends and seasonal patterns using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **historical daily weather data from the United Kingdom spanning over six decades (1961–2024)**.

The main objective is to understand how weather patterns such as **temperature and rainfall** have changed over time and how they vary across seasons and decades.

The analysis emphasizes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to extract meaningful insights from raw climate data.
